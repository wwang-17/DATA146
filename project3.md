Given that there are 715 rows in total, I have tried 8, 10, 12, 15 folds and the corresponding average of train and test scores are as the following:
k = 8: train score: 0.019477178686178; test score: -0.024545646835335944
k = 10: train score: 0.019514638368914018; test score: -0.037502267848572614
k = 12: train score: 0.019399126134301125; test score: -0.025932644957946994
k = 15: train score: 0.019206809563629627; test score: -0.036841997269859754
