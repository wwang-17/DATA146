### Question 1
continuous: quantitative data that is able to take any value within a range. Examples are weight, height, temperature, and age.

ordinal: categorical data with an intrinsic order. Only the order but not the difference between them is important. A typical example is ranking.

nominal: categorical data without an intrinsic order. Examples are countries and cities.

An exemplary model could be a linear regression model that aims to predict a salesman's salary(target) based on one's educational level(ordinal: below high school, 
high school, BS, MS, PhD), ethnicity(nominal: minority/non-minority), and average sales per month(continuous), which are features.

### Question 2
1) When alpha=beta, the beta distribution is symmetric with its mean at located at the center. When I set alpha=beta=5 and generate 1000 random observations I got the following distribution.
* mean = 0.5003436291300151
* median = 3.5005643139370388
